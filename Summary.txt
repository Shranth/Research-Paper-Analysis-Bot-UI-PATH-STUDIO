Title: AI-Driven Medical Diagnosis: Comparing CNN and Transformer Models
Brief Research Outline:
Objective: Analyze the effectiveness of CNNs vs. Transformer models in diagnosing diseases from medical images.

Data: Use public datasets (e.g., Chest X-rays, Diabetic Retinopathy images).

Methodology:

Train CNN (ResNet, EfficientNet) and Transformer (ViT, Swin) models.

Compare performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

Challenges Addressed:

Handling noisy/low-quality medical images.

Ensuring AI interpretability for medical professionals.

Expected Outcome: Identify the best AI model for real-world medical diagnosis.

Future Scope: Integration into healthcare systems, bias reduction, and federated learning for privacy.

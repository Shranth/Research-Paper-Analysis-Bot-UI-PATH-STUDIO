The document, "Deep Learning for Stock Market Forecasting: A Review of Models and Challenges," authored by Dhaval Mehta, Nipun Dahiya, Ishani Saha, and Payal Mishra from NMIMS University, Mumbai, explores AI/ML models for stock price prediction, addressing their complexity, non-linearity, and volatility. The review evaluates models like XGBoost, RNN, LSTM, ANN, CNN, DQN, and KNN. Inference: XGBoost excels in handling large datasets with regularization to minimize overfitting, while RNNs and LSTMs capture short- and long-term dependencies, respectively, though RNNs struggle with vanishing gradients. LSTMs perform well in volatile markets but require extensive resources. ANNs learn non-linear patterns but risk overfitting, mitigated by hybrid models like ANN-ARIMA. CNNs are adept at short-term trend extraction but need LSTM for long-term dependencies. DQN optimizes trading via reinforcement learning, yet demands significant computational power. KNN is simple and effective for small datasets but inefficient for large ones. Pros: Models offer high accuracy, handle non-linear dat
